//! Delivery into a Claude Code session: `lunchroom listen`, an `asyncRewake` hook on `SessionStart`
//! and `Stop`, wakes the session with one message's envelope; the guard's `UserPromptSubmit` hook
//! sees that prompt before the model does and confirms it there (D1.1). Codex and OpenClaw take a
//! message through their own commands (`codex.rs`, `openclaw.rs`); in Hermes, Lunchroom's plugin
//! runs `lunchroom listen --once` in `pre_llm_call` and hands the envelope to the session's next
//! turn, and its `pre_api_request` hook passes the turn's request to the guard's prompt hook,
//! which confirms it when the request carries it (D1.1).
//!
//! Spec: §10 D1, §13 H1.1 item 4. Host facts: `docs/host-facts/claude-code.md`
//! section 3 (a rewake's text passes through `UserPromptSubmit`).

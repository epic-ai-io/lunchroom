//! The Claude Code adapter's guard evidence (R3.1, H1.1 item 2).
//!
//! A Claude Code session is guarded when a guard hook recorded it in its current Claude Code process
//! (the process still runs under the same `<pid>:<start time>`) and a settings file that Claude Code
//! loads for it still runs Lunchroom's complete guard set, `PreToolUse`, `PostToolUse`,
//! `PostToolUseFailure` and `UserPromptSubmit`, each covering every call (`configured_with`): the
//! managed `/etc/claude-code/managed-settings.json`, the user's `settings.json` (in
//! `CLAUDE_CONFIG_DIR`, or `~/.claude`), the project's `.claude/settings.json` and
//! `.claude/settings.local.json` in the folder it ran in, as `--setting-sources` leaves them, or a
//! file or text given to that process with `--settings`, unless `--bare` or `disableAllHooks`
//! switches the hooks off. A session no hook recorded, or whose process has ended, is STOPPED; one
//! that runs without that configuration is UNGUARDED.
//!
//! OpenClaw and Hermes load Lunchroom's plugin into the harness process, and the plugin starts the
//! guard; the guard records the plugin's file. Such a session is guarded while that file still
//! runs a Lunchroom program that is there to run, and, for OpenClaw, which applies plugin settings
//! to a running gateway, while `openclaw.json` still enables the plugin with conversation access
//! (`before_agent_run`, which confirms deliveries and sees another agent's text, runs only then).
//! Host facts: `docs/host-facts/openclaw-and-hermes.md`.

  1. Relaxed: agents act on each other's messages freely; Lunchroom still stops injection into
     other sessions, impersonating you, and leaking secrets, and changes to Lunchroom come to you.
  2. Balanced (recommended): agents act freely, but pushes, publishes, deletes, sending data out
     of this computer, credentials and changes to Lunchroom come to you.
  3. Strict: everything an agent would change after another agent's message waits for you.
Every tool-call guard has this limit: once a script runs, the guard does not see what it does.
Only Strict, without `lunchroom yolo`, stops a HELD agent's scripts.
Codex cannot show an approval prompt: what would come to you there is blocked instead and waits
for `lunchroom approve`.

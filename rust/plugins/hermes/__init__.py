"""Lunchroom's Hermes plugin (spec §13 H1; host facts docs/host-facts/openclaw-and-hermes.md).

It hands each Hermes event to Lunchroom's guard program and turns the guard's answer into
Hermes's: a call that goes ahead returns ``None``; one that goes to the user returns ``approve``
with a rule key unique to the call, so a "session" or "always" answer never covers another call
(A1.1); a DENIED call returns ``block``. Before each call the plugin reads Hermes's own approval
gate and tells the guard whether a person would be asked (A1.2). ``pre_llm_call`` tells the guard
whether the turn's text is the user's own typing (T1), then hands the next waiting message to the
turn; ``pre_api_request`` passes the turn's request to the guard, which confirms the message when
the request carries it (D1.1). A guard that cannot decide, its program missing included, sends the
call to the user, or DENIES it where nobody can answer (H1.5); the user's own typing is never
blocked.
``pre_llm_call`` cannot block a turn, so when the guard could not judge a turn that is not the
user's typing, the plugin itself sends every later call of that session to the user, or DENIES
it where nobody can answer, until the guard has judged a turn the user typed (T1, H1.5).
``lunchroom install hermes`` writes this file with the program's path in place of the marker.
